!variables for per-residue binding energy
double precision, allocatable      :: energy_per_res(:, :) !stores binding energy per residue
!real            , allocatable      :: res_select_p_vector(:) !stores probability of selecting a residue to be mutated
!character*4                        :: decomp_score_type = "INV" 

!variables for neighbor list (currently not used)
real                     :: neighbor_cutoff2 = 9999 !beyond this distance, two atoms not considered neighbors and will not calculate pair-wise energy. By default, this value is large so all atoms are neighbors
!integer                 :: neighbor_length = 200 !should be more than enough to store all neighbors for each residue in the peptide
!integer  , allocatable  :: neighbor_list(:,:)   !will store index to neighbor residues for each residue in the ligand (NOTE: doing this on a per-residue basis) 
!integer  , allocatable  :: neighbor_list_lens(:) !will store how many neighbors each ligand residue has
!real *8, allocatable    :: neighbor_rec_res_box_edges(:,:) !will store edges of each receptor's box edges to determine distance from each ligand residue' box edges

!Tabu search parameters; NOTE: Not recommended to use this, doesn't make design more effective
!integer, allocatable    :: TABU_allowed_residues(:) !list of amino acid positions that CAN be mutated
!integer                 :: TABU_ban_length = 0 !number of mutations that mutated residue cannot be changed. NOT EQUAL TO STEPS!! There are n sequence mutations per step, where n is the number of amino acids in the peptide
!integer, allocatable    :: TABU_ban_lengths(:) !stores list of how long tabu residues have been on the tabu list. list decremented, so residue can be mutated again once the length = 0
!integer                 :: TABU_allowed_length !stores number of residues currently allowed by TABU search
